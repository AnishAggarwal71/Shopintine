##Overview of the Problem

In this COVID-19 pandemic which has affected 213 Countries and Territories, the common folks are facing an ample amount of problems with the constant fear of catching the virus. Even for containment of the virus issuing lockdown has been a well-prepared strategy by the government but one of the major problems one might face in this total lockdown situation is the availability of shops and the probability of exposure at their regulars. With only a few shops/general stores available there is a chance of the place getting crowded and unsafe for the shoppers and the shopkeeper.
